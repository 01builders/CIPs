## Abstract


## Motivation


## Specification
The specification has been copied directly from the ICS-27 specification approved in the ibc protocol repository.

### Definitions



## Rationale

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

## Backwards Compatibility

This section is optional.

All CIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The CIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. CIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft: *"No backward compatibility issues found."*

**TODO: Remove the previous comments before submitting**

## Test Cases

This section is optional.

The Test Cases section should include expected input/output pairs, but may include a succinct set of executable tests. It should not include project build files. No new requirements may be be introduced here (meaning an implementation following only the Specification section should pass all tests here.)

If the test suite is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/cip-####/`. External links will not be allowed

## Reference Implementation

This section is optional.

The Reference Implementation section should include a minimal implementation that assists in understanding or implementing this specification. It should not include project build files. The reference implementation is not a replacement for the Specification section, and the proposal should still be understandable without it.

If the reference implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/cip-####/`. External links will not be allowed.

## Security Considerations

All CIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. For example, include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. CIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An CIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.

The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.
